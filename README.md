This post to display a collection of images using Vue 3.

The collection of images.

The item id is used to define the (index of the item) from the items array as a result of the click event.
We need the item index so that the styleObject can be located for the chg method to resize.

The conclusion from this post, so far, is:

With Vue 3, the code was far less than the similar display of images design with vanilla JavaScript.

I have uploaded the HTML and image directory.

I have left the style properties inside the index.html file.

It seems to load smoother as opposed to an external CSS file.
